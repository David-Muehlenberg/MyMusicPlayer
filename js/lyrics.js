        lyrics: `He bends and he breaks
        If you kiss it will take away
        His passion, his pain, his brain
        he excels
        A thousand black flowers explode
        Into butterflies as they're away
        Rip them, I'll take them
        Burn to coals as they crush
        And leave nothing that
        Resembles a soul of a man
        See him numb, see him crushed
        See him numb, see him crushed
        Rip them, I'll take them
        Burn to coals as they crush
        And leave nothing that
        Resembles a soul of a man
        Leave him numb, leave him crushed
        Leave him numb, leave him crushed
        Just a fire inside one too many times
        He's burning over and out now he fails
        Up against the raging tides
        No more fights
        Everything you ever wanted to see
        I see it in his eyes
        One more time, one more time
        My time to test the waters
        My hands feel like they're rusting away
        So obvious, so numb, I can leave before the slaughter
        I'll stay here, as long as you let me
        Decisions, then, made obvious, and while they're in tune
        Where I started, I'll stay there
        When I'm finished
        I'll wither away
        Rip them, I'll take them
        Burn to coals as they crush
        And leave nothing that
        Resembles a soul of a man
        See him numb, see him crushed
        See him numb, see him crushed
        Rip them, I'll take them
        Burn to coals as they crush
        And leave nothing that
        Resembles a soul of a man
        Leave him numb, leave him crushed
        Leave him numb, leave him crushed`,

        lyrics: `Urban Hipster, the new gangster frontin' by the club
        New wave mannequins packin' haircuts, instead of packin' guns
        Magazines form overseas, won?t teach you how to feel
        They trade in their hearts for indie rock charts to tell them what is real
        When did they assume? Putting on a costume
        Gave them a right to ostracize
        Out of the woodwork art aficionados
        Answer one question?
        Where is the line? Where is the line?
        Between your fashion and your mind
        Where is the line? Where is the line?
        'Cause some of us aren't blind!
        Where is the line? Where is the line?
        To be your self is not a crime
        Where is the line? Where is the line?
        'Cause some of us aren't blind!
        She sells street cred with no smile, at the local record store
        She's acting the role and dressing the part, pretending to be bored
        The truth about conformity, is it bites without a sting
        Trends come and go, but when your alone it doesn't mean a thing
        When did they assume? Putting on a costume
        Gave them a right to ostracize
        Out of the woodwork art aficionados
        Answer one question?
        Where is the line? Where is the line?
        Between your fashion and your mind
        Where is the line? Where is the line?
        'Cause some of us aren't blind!
        Where is the line? Where is the line?
        To be your self is not a crime
        Where is the line? Where is the line?
        'Cause some of us aren't blind!
        Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
        Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!
        Here today, but forgotten tomorrow!`,

        lyrics: `You got the look, but not the credit
        They wrote the book, on how to sell it
        From cigarettes, to skinny jeans
        You got the money, they got the means
        Oh you upper class daughters, and working class sons
        It's hard to save a dollar, the way the world runs
        You're the target market of a corporate joke
        It won't be so ironic when your daddy is broke
        Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
        You're much better looking when you're in disguise
        Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
        And this revolution has been brought to you by
        Just gotta stop, so you can mimic
        The tortured artist, the jaded cynic
        The latest gadget, is just a gimmick
        Another sucker, born every minute
        Well I'm sick of this town, bringing me down
        A vast world epidemic all around
        I'm sick of this town, bringing me down
        A lost generation trying to act profound
        Oh you upper class daughters, and working class sons
        It's hard to save a dollar the way the world runs
        We got a counterculture you can buy of a shelf
        If you're losing your identity to somebody else
        Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
        You're much better looking when you're in disguise
        Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
        And this revolution has been brought to you by
        Those who seek to think we don't care
        And those who seek to think we're not aware
        Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
        You're much better looking when you're in disguise
        Call the ranks,
        Call the ranks,
        Call the ranks
        Oh you working class daughters, and upper class sons
        It's hard to save a dollar the way the world runs
        We're the target market of a corporate hoax
        Our generation is a fucking joke
        Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
        You're much better looking when you're in disguise
        Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
        And this revolution has been brought to you by
        Those who seek to think we don't care
        And those who seek to think we're not aware

        City's breaking down on a camel's back
        They just have to go 'cause they don't know whack
        So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
        You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
        You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
        A melancholy town where we never smile
        And all I wanna hear is the message beep
        My dreams, they got her kissing, 'cause I don't get sleep, no

        We're only deceiving ourselves

        Make up your mind
        Couldn't take the blame, sick with shame
        Must be exhausting to lose your own game, selfishly hated
        No wonder you're jaded

        And you're too late
        Don't cry to me, if you loved me

        You never call me when you're sober
        You only want it 'cause it's over, it's over
        How could I have burned paradise?
        How could I?
        You were never mine!

        And I ain't mad at'cha
        Never leave you alone
        'Cause it's on when I'm home
        Like it's on when I'm gone
        We both grown, both got minds of our own
        Plus we hit off courtside like Love Jones
        Been, in many zones, baby
        Love it or hate it
        Went from prizzy women, to women that throw the shadow
        But you know, the Rule be livin' it up
        They got all of y'all givin' it up
        I like a little Rule baby, how cute are you?
        With a body that rides on sexual
        I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you
        Doing doughnuts and cuts then I open it up
        On the freeway, hair on her wheel, foot on the clutch

        I gotta hold you somehow
        I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
        You wanna touch me too
        Everyday but all I have is time
        Our loves the perfect crime
        I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
        You wanna touch me too
        Every way and when they set me free
        Just put your hands on me
        Tonight I'm weak
        It's just another day without you
        That I can't sleep
        I gave the world away for you to
        Hear me say
        Don't throw me away
        There's no way out
        I gotta hold you somehow
        All I wanna do is touch you
        I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
        You wanna touch me too
        Everyday but all I have is time
        Our loves the perfect crime
        I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
        You wanna touch me too
        Every way and when they set me free
        Just put your hands on me
        I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
        You wanna touch me too
        Everyday but all I have is time
        Our loves the perfect crime
        I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
        You wanna touch me too
        Every way and when they set me free
        Just put your hands on me
